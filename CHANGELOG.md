# Changelog

Everything worth knowing about a release of Arandu Wallet is recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
the versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

A published module version is immutable: Go serves it from the proxy forever, so
a release is corrected by another release and never by moving a tag.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing has been released under this module path yet. The versions below are the
history of the package template this repository was configured from, carried
over with every other file it holds; they describe releases of the template and
not of this package.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- `(*Module).Publishes` declares one `foundation.Publication`, tagged as a view.
  The contract belongs to the framework, so whatever writes the files reads
  every module through one interface instead of one this package defined for
  itself.

### Changed

- The minimum Framework version is now `v0.46.0`, with Hesape `v0.25.0`.
- `(*Module).Publishes` returns `[]foundation.Publication` instead of `io/fs.FS`.
- `PublishCommand` is now `aru vendor:publish --apply`.
- `(*Module).Boot` names the package whose import links the views, alongside the
  view and the command.

### Removed

- `Publishable`, the contract this package declared for itself.
  `foundation.Publishable` is the one it answers now.
- `Publishes`, the package-level function. There was a second form because a
  command with no database handle could not hold a `Module`; there is no such
  command any more.
- `publish`, the command of this module. `aru vendor:publish` reads the modules
  an application registered and writes what each one declares, which is a
  question only the application can answer.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- `Publishable`, the optional contract a module answers to hand files to the
  application, and `Publishes()` on `Module`.
- `PublishedPaths`, `ViewNames` and `ViewPackages`, the three spellings of one
  view derived from the archive rather than written down separately.
- `PublishCommand`, the one spelling of the command that copies the views.
- `publish`, a command of this module: `go run <module>/publish@latest` writes
  the views under `resources/views/vendor/<module>/`, refuses to replace a file
  the project already has without `--force`, and prints the imports that link
  them.
- `(*Module).Boot` refuses to serve when a view this package renders was never
  published, naming the view and the command instead of answering the first
  request that reaches it with a 500.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- `Wallets(db)` exposes the configured, tenant-scoped Model used by the
  Service after authorization.

### Changed

- The minimum Framework version is now `v0.41.0`, with Hesape `v0.19.1`.
- `NewWalletService` now accepts `*data.DB` instead of
  `*WalletRepository`.
- `(*WalletService).Create` now returns `(*Wallet, error)`.
- `(*WalletService).Find` now returns `(*Wallet, error)`.
- `(*WalletService).List` now returns `([]*Wallet, error)`.
- `Wallet`: old is comparable; new is not because it embeds
  `model.Model[Wallet]`. Compare stable fields such as `ID` instead.

### Removed

- `WalletRepository` and `NewWalletRepository`.
- `(*WalletRepository).Create`, `(*WalletRepository).Delete`,
  `(*WalletRepository).Find`, `(*WalletRepository).List`, and
  `(*WalletRepository).Update`. Add a Repository only for specialized
  queries, reports, projections, read models, exports, or external storage.
